# **VYNYL**

VYNYL is a platform for music lovers to share and rate albums together. At it's core it serves as a place where users can learn more about their favourite albums and create listening groups with other music enthusiasts to serve as a sort of 'Audio book-club'. This project has allowed me to blend my passion for software and music and I hope that others can enjoy using what I have enjoyed making!

VYNYL is built using the MERN stack with TypeScript, using the Last.fm Api for data on music albums and artists. This is still in early development and new features are actively being worked on.
